## Media

- A short [video documentary](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1ad0c8057ff444a48d8e6656d7877168) Israel shared called “Water is Life”
included a reference to a Rio Grande story map produced by a
young woman named Esperanza Chairez, who used to work at Nuestra
Tierra (and who spoke at an NMSU-sponsored climate change speaker
series event in October 2022).  Geography professor Eric Magrane at NMSU guided me to it.

- short [river-focused documentary film](https://youtu.be/eefK09DGg4E?si=sIIxxOg3GSjDQjjM) created by Annie Ersinghaus,
an NMSU alum and former student of film instructor Ilana Lapid.
Ersinghaus took some drone footage of the water flowing down the
Rio Grande channel after release in 2022.
